# Snake_Game_Java

# Game dirsciption
We have a rattlesnake in a desert, and our snake is initially two units long (head and rattler). We must
collect with our snake the foods on the level, that appears randomly. Only one food piece is placed
randomly at a time on the level (on a field, where there isno snake). The snake starts off from the center
of the level in a random direction. The player can control the movement of the snakeâ€™s head with
keyboard buttons. If the snake eats a food piece, then its length grows by one unit. It makes the game
harder that there are rocks in the desert. If the snake collides with a rock, then the game ends. We also
lose the game, if the snake goes into itself, or into the boundary of the game level. In these situations,
show a popup message box, where the player can type his name and save it together with the amount
of food eaten to the database. Create a menu item, which displays a highscore table of the players for
the 10 best scores. Also, create a menu item which restarts the game.

# How to run the game
You will need to have netbeans IDE then you easly open the project,
create a database, create a highscore database with 4 filds (timestemp, name, level, score) 
then connect the database and run the game!
if you don't have netbeans IDE then you have to find a way to connect the game with a database!
